# MySunshine
My version of the Sunshine Android app based on the Udacity class

To build, you will need a new APPID.java file consisting of an interface APPID.
It should look like this:
public interface APPID {
    String WEATHERMAP_APPID = "<your app key goes here>";
}

Fill the String with your personal app key from openweathermap.org
